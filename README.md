## Project Overview

This project explores the application of reinforcement learning to build a music recommendation system. The goal is to develop an agent that can learn user preferences and provide relevant song recommendations, enhancing the user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.11.9
-   pip
-   VS Code (or your preferred editor)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/samuelsurr/music-recommendation-rl.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/samuelsurr/music-recommendation-rl.git)
    cd music-recommendation-rl
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow tf-agents gym numpy pandas matplotlib librosa
    ```


## Reinforcement Learning Approach

-   **Environment:** Custom Gym environment representing the music recommendation scenario.
-   **Agent:** Using TensorFlow Agents, potentially using DQN, DDPG, or other suitable algorithms.
-   **Reward Function:** Designed to incentivize relevant song recommendations based on user interactions.
-   **State Representation:** User profile, recent listening history, and song metadata.
